        <p>My software development journey was accelerated. The constant mention of tech job availability in Nashville, and the lack of qualified candidates, sent me looking for ways I could learn the industry. I'm sure like most people, I was unaware of what it meant to be in the field. I happened upon Pivot Tech on Facebook. The mission statement resonated with me being a person of color feeling the need to bridge the wealth gap.</p>
        <p>I have always liked using computers. I probably had a computer before any of my peers (1998). Burning CD's and making cool school projects with Word. Having been to a magnet school, I was exposed to “coding” in the sixth grade. But I didn't know exactly what it was, nor did anyone close to me. Not knowing what that meant I didn't pursue it.</p>
        <p>Currently my partner and I have businesses that would benefit from web exposure. Setting those things up yourself when you don't exactly have an idea of what you need is daunting. I hope to learn a lot about building engaging websites that lead to sales.</p>
