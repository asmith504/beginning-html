        <p><h5>Current Career</h5></p>
        <p>Currently I'm a stay-at-home mom. A unicorn amongst my peers. More African American women should have the option of being their children's full-time caregiver before and into school age. I love being able to experience my child's first milestones. Being able to help her through tough times with that one-on-one time is amazing. We don't have the constraints a lot of parents have when it comes to time management. I hope to set my child up for the future, so she has all the exposure she needs.</p>
        <p><h5>Hobbies</h5></p>
        <p>Both of my favorite hobbies were born out of necessity. I was having a hard time finding clothing that fit correctly. I had the big idea of learning to sew my own. I started out at the library, and then found internet tutorials on you tube. After sewing on my kitchen table for a while and cutting patterns out on the floor, I knew I needed something else. I searched for the right desk and sewing station, and I couldn't find anything. Now I'm a full blown woodworker. I built shelves to hold my fabric collection and sewing machines (5). I made a desk to both hold my computer and to cut fabric up to a yard. </p>
        <p><h5>Favorite Sport and Team</h5></p>
        <p>This will be short and sweet. I'm not a die-hard fan of any sport really. I will represent for my city. Tennessee Titans have broken my little fan heart on numerous occasions, but I still remember the referendum to get them here, and the Music City Miracle that granted them a place in my forever heart. Titan Up!</p>
        <p><h5>Favorite Food</h5></p>
        <p>I really love a lot of different foods. But bacon is a solid pick and never disappointing. It goes on so many things. Elevates all sandwiches. The best bacon I've ever had was at a Bourbon and Bacon Festival. The chef called it lardon, and if you haven't had that and are a pork eating individual get some. </p>
